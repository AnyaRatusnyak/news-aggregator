- Spring Data MongoDB: For database interactions.
- Spring Web: For building web-based applications with Spring MVC.
- MongoDB: Primary database for storing user data and news articles.
- Elasticsearch: Search and filter capabilities for news articles based on preferences and keywords.
- Maven: For project management and dependency management.
